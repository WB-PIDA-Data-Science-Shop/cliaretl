\usage{
flag_missing_indicators(
  db_variables,
  df,
  source_type = NULL,
  source_colname = "source"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db_variables}{A data frame containing a column named `variable` with the list of valid variable names.
It can also contain a column (specified by `source_colname`) with source information.}

\item{df}{A data frame containing extracted indicators along with identifying columns such as `country_code`, `country_name`, and `year`.}

\item{source_type}{Optional. A character string specifying the source to filter the dictionary (e.g., "WDI").
If provided, only variables associated with this source type will be considered from `db_variables`.}

\item{source_colname}{Optional. A character string specifying the name of the column in `db_variables`
that contains the source information. Defaults to `"source"`. This allows for flexibility if the source
column is named differently (e.g., `"etl_source"`).}
}
\value{
A tibble with one column, `variable`, listing the variables from `db_variables` that are missing in `df`.
}
\description{
Identifies variables that are in the dictionary (`db_variables`) but missing from the given data frame.
This function offers flexibility by allowing the user to specify the column in `db_variables` that contains
the source information, which can be different from the default "source" column.
