\title{Compute coverage and summary statistics for indicators}
\usage{
compute_coverage(data, country_id, year_id, ref_year)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing indicator values along with
country and year identifiers.}

\item{country_id}{A column identifying countries (e.g., `country_code`).}

\item{year_id}{A column identifying years.}

\item{ref_year}{A numeric value indicating the most recent year of reference
(used to calculate last-five-years coverage and continuity flags).}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per indicator and the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{Indicator}{Indicator name.}
  \item{Country Coverage}{Number of countries with non-missing values.}
  \item{Year Coverage}{Number of years with non-missing values.}
  \item{Flag Continuity}{Logical or numeric flag for continuity up to `ref_year`.}
  \item{Flag Country Coverage}{Flag for sufficient cross-country coverage.}
  \item{Flag Year Coverage}{Flag for sufficient time coverage.}
  \item{Year Range}{Earliest and latest years with available data.}
  \item{Percentage of Complete Records}{Proportion of complete cases overall.}
  \item{Percentage of Complete Records in Last Five Years}{Proportion complete near `ref_year`.}
  \item{Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Minimum, Maximum}{Basic summary statistics.}
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates coverage and data quality for a set of indicators
across countries and years. It summarizes country coverage, year coverage,
continuity flags, completeness, and basic descriptive statistics (mean,
median, standard deviation, min, max) for each indicator in a dataset.
}
\details{
The function computes, for each indicator:
- **Country Coverage**: number of distinct countries with non-missing values.
- **Year Coverage**: number of distinct years with non-missing values.
- **Flag Continuity**: indicator of whether values are continuous up to `ref_year`.
- **Flag Country Coverage**: indicator of sufficient country coverage
  (requires access to `country_region_list`).
- **Flag Year Coverage**: indicator of whether minimum year coverage criteria are met.
- **Year Range**: minimum and maximum year observed with non-missing values.
- **Percentage of Complete Records**: share of complete observations.
- **Percentage of Complete Records in Last Five Years**: completeness restricted
  to the period close to `ref_year`.
- **Summary statistics**: mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.
