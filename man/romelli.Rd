\description{
This dataset provides an annual panel of central bank independence (CBI) scores for countries,
based on the unweighted index developed by Cukierman et al. (1992) and recomputed by Romelli using
updated legal and institutional data.
}
\details{
The index ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents the lowest level of independence and 1 the highest.
It measures de jure independence, focusing on aspects such as governor appointment, monetary policy formulation,
central bank objectives, and limitations on lending to the government.
