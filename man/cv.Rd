\title{Coefficient of Variation}
\usage{
cv(x, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of values.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, missing values are removed before
computation. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the coefficient of variation.
}
\description{
Computes the coefficient of variation (CV), defined as the ratio of the
standard deviation to the mean. This is a scale-free measure of dispersion
that allows comparison of variability between datasets with different units
or magnitudes.
}
\details{
The coefficient of variation is computed as
\deqn{CV = \frac{sd(x)}{mean(x)}}{CV = sd(x) / mean(x)}.
If \code{mean(x)} is zero or very close to zero, the result may be
undefined or unstable.
}
\examples{
x <- c(10, 12, 9, 11, 13)
cv(x)
cv(x, na.rm = TRUE)
