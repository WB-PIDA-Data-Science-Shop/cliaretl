\usage{
compare_pipeline_indicators(old_df, new_df, plot_save_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{old_df}{A data frame containing the previous pipeline results.}

\item{new_df}{A data frame containing the new pipeline results.}

\item{plot_save_path}{Optional file path (including filename) for saving
the heatmap as a PNG. If \code{NULL}, the heatmap is not saved.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
  \item \code{agent} — pointblank validation agent summary
  \item \code{difference_table} — rows where indicator values changed or were updated
  \item \code{avg_abs_diff} — a data frame of mean absolute percent differences
        by indicator and year, averaged across countries
  \item \code{heatmap} — the ggplot2 heatmap of average absolute differences
}
}
\description{
This function compares two versions of harmonized pipeline outputs and
generates:
\itemize{
  \item a pointblank validation audit,
  \item a table of rows where indicator values changed or were newly added,
  \item a year–by–indicator heatmap of \strong{average absolute percentage differences}
        across all countries.
}
It also optionally saves the heatmap to disk.
