\title{Compare CLIAR Pipeline Indicator Values Across Versions}
\usage{
compare_pipeline_indicators(old_df, new_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{old_df}{A data frame representing the old CLIAR dataset (e.g., already published).
Must include `country_code`, `year`, and indicator columns.}

\item{new_df}{A data frame representing the new CLIAR dataset (e.g., updated data for new release).
Must include `country_code`, `year`, and indicator columns.}
}
\value{
A data frame (tibble) showing rows where indicator values have changed or are mismatched
(i.e., not equal or include `NA`s). Also prints a `pointblank` interrogation report to the console.
}
\description{
This function compares the indicator values between an old (published) and a new (updated)
version of a CLIAR pipeline dataset. It identifies changes in values for matching country-year-indicator
combinations and flags differences. A [pointblank](https://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/)
agent report is generated to summarize changes.
}
\details{
- Only compares indicators common to both `old_df` and `new_df`.
- Assumes both data frames are in wide format, with indicator variables as columns.
- Indicator values are compared for all shared `(country_code, year, indicator)` triples.
- Differences due to `NA` mismatches are also reported.
