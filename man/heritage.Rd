\title{Heritage Index of Economic Freedom Data}
\format{
A tibble with 2,381 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
  \item{country_code}{A three-letter World Bank 3166-1 alpha-3 country code identifying the country.}
  \item{year}{The year of the score, adjusted so that a given year's value reflects the conditions of the previous year.}
  \item{heritage_business_freedom}{Score measuring the extent to which the regulatory and infrastructure environments constrain the efficient operation of businesses.
  A higher score indicates fewer regulatory barriers and more ease in starting, operating, and closing a business.}
  \item{heritage_financial_freedom}{Score reflecting banking efficiency and independence from government control or interference in the financial sector.
  State ownership of banks and other financial institutions typically reduces competition and lowers credit access.}
  \item{heritage_investment_freedom}{Score based on the degree of regulatory restrictions on investment activities.
  Deductions are made from a baseline score of 100 for various restrictions; countries with extremely high levels of restriction may receive a score of 0.}

\description{
A dataset containing country-level scores from the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom, focused on freedom indicators relevant to business, finance, and investment sectors.

\details{
The business freedom component measures the extent to which the regulatory and infrastructure environments constrain the efficient operation of businesses. The quantitative score is derived from an array of factors that affect the ease of starting, operating, and closing a business.

Financial freedom is both an indicator of banking efficiency and a measure of independence from government control and interference in the financial sector. State ownership of banks and other financial institutions such as insurers and capital markets reduces competition and generally lowers access to credit.

The investment freedom score reflects the degree of regulatory restrictions imposed on investment. Deductions are applied from the ideal score of 100 for each type of restriction. Countries with very high levels of restriction may receive a score of zero.
