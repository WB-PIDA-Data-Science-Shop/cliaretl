\title{OECD Product Market Regulation (PMR) Indicators (Renamed for CLIAR Dashboard)}
\format{
A tibble with 94 rows and 9 variables:
\describe{
  \item{year}{Year of observation (e.g., 2018 or 2023).}
  \item{country_code}{ISO3 country code.}
  \item{oecd_pmr_2018_2_1}{\strong{Retail Price Controls and Regulation} — measures the extent and type of retail price controls in key network and service sectors, as well as in the retail distribution of certain goods and services.}
  \item{oecd_pmr_2018_3_3}{\strong{Communication and Simplification of Administrative and Regulatory Burden} — measures the existence of an online database of all laws and regulations and regulatory agenda, the requirement of plain language drafting of laws and regulations, the principle of risk proportionality for new licensing requirements, and the application of a ‘silence is consent’ rule for issuing new licenses.}
  \item{oecd_pmr_2018_2_2_2}{\strong{Involvement in Business Operations in Services Sectors} — measures the extent to which the government imposes restrictions on the conduct of firms in key service sectors (e.g., restrictions on the ownership and legal form of professional firms, restrictions on the geographic location of pharmacies, regulation of retail shop opening hours).}
  \item{oecd_pmr_2018_2_2_1}{\strong{Involvement in Business Operations in Network Sectors} — measures the extent to which the government imposes restrictions on the conduct of firms in key network sectors (e.g., regulation of fixed and mobile number portability, constraints on airline route and frequency choices).}
  \item{oecd_pmr_2018_1_4}{\strong{Governance of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)} — measures the rationale for public ownership, the degree of insulation from market discipline, the degree of political interference in SOE operations, and the arrangement of public service obligations.}
  \item{oecd_pmr_2018_6}{\strong{Barriers to Trade and Investment (Composite Index)} — captures barriers that could limit the access of foreign firms and investors to domestic markets. In this dataset, it is calculated as the average of the FDI and tariff barriers subcomponents.}
  \item{oecd_pmr_2018_1_3}{\strong{Scope of Direct and Indirect Control of Firms by the State} — measures whether the government controls directly or indirectly, via special voting rights, at least one firm in 24 sectors (including seven network sectors). This indicator is combined with \code{oecd_pmr_2018_1_4} to form the low-level indicator on the Quality and Scope of Public Ownership.}

\description{
A tidy dataset containing the key 2018 and 2023 OECD Product Market Regulation
(PMR) indicators, standardized for the CLIAR dashboard. These indicators measure
the degree to which policies promote or inhibit competition in areas of the economy
where competition is viable. The dataset includes multiple low-level components
of the PMR framework, focusing on barriers to entry, state control, and regulatory
burdens.
}
\details{
The PMR indicators form part of the OECD’s broader effort to assess the regulatory
environment for product markets and its implications for economic performance.
These indicators are organized under three high-level components:
\enumerate{
  \item \emph{Barriers to Domestic and Foreign Entry} — includes administrative burdens, barriers in service and network sectors, and barriers to trade and investment.
  \item \emph{Public Ownership} — includes measures of state control and governance of SOEs.
  \item \emph{Administrative and Regulatory Burdens} — includes measures of communication, simplification, and transparency in the regulatory process.
