\description{
This dataset provides numeric scores for eight OECD PMR indicators, which assess the extent of
product market regulation across key domains. Higher scores generally indicate more restrictive
or interventionist policy environments.
}
\details{
This dataset contains a selection of indicators from the 2018 OECD Product Market Regulation (PMR)
database for 49 countries. These indicators measure various aspects of government involvement in
business, market openness, and regulatory quality.


\itemize{
  \item \strong{oecd_pmr_2018_1_1:} Measures whether the government controls at least one firm in a number of business sectors, with a higher weight given to key network sectors.
  \item \strong{oecd_pmr_2018_1_2:} Measures the size of the governmentâ€™s stake in the largest firm in key network sectors.
  \item \strong{oecd_pmr_2018_1_3:} Measures the existence of special voting rights by the government in privately owned firms and constraints on the sale of government stakes.
  \item \strong{oecd_pmr_2018_1_4:} Captures how policymakers interact with stakeholders when shaping business regulations. Considers forward planning, consultation, feedback, RIA, and transparency.
  \item \strong{oecd_pmr_2018_2_1:} Measures whether tariffs are regulated and whether laws limit competition. Higher values imply worse performance.
  \item \strong{oecd_pmr_2018_2_2:} Measures SOE autonomy in market decisions (e.g. operating hours, routes), and whether utilities disclose tariff and usage info. Higher values are worse.
  \item \strong{oecd_pmr_2018_3_3:} Simple average of (i) use of one-stop shops/silence-is-consent rule and (ii) government communication to reduce administrative burden.
  \item \strong{oecd_pmr_2018_6:} Simple average of (i) restrictiveness of FDI rules (equity limits, approvals, staffing, operations) and (ii) average applied tariffs.
