The goal of cliaretl is to be the central data pipeline responsible for sourcing, processing and delivering the data to the CLIAR dashboard. Its primary function is to execute a robust Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process, ensuring the dashboard always has access to accurate and harmonized data. It provides the following features:

-   Automated Data Extraction: Programmatically pulls raw data from various external services through efficient API calls.

-   Data Harmonization: Merges and standardizes data originating from both API endpoints and manual input sources. This ensures data consistency and reliability, regardless of its origin.

-   Data Preparation: Transforms raw and harmonized data into a clean, structured, and optimized format, making it available to use in the CLIAR dashboard. This process also facilitates version control for the data, ensuring traceability and reproducibility.

-   Data Quality Testing: Implements a modular testing approach to verify data quality at various stages of the ETL pipeline, ensuring data integrity and reliability before it reaches the dashboard.

## Project Structure

The Package is structured to facilitate the ETL process, with the following key components:

```

## Package Installation

Install the cliaretl package with:

``` r
# Step 1. Install the packages 'pak' or 'remotes' if you don't have them:

# install.packages("pak")
# install.packages("remotes")


# Step 2. Install cliaretl from GitHub:
remotes::install_github("WB-PIDA-Data-Science-Shop/cliaretl")
```

## Reproducibility

The cliaretl package uses `renv` to lock package versions, ensuring consistent results across environments and dependencies management. To set up the project environment for package development, run `renv::restore()`.
